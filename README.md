HipSpot
=======

HipSpot is a location-based game made during Foursquare Hackathon 2013. Players can check-in via Foursquare and check out the available rewards and deals offered by nearby merchants. Playing the mini-games will bring the user various rewards that are redeemable on the spot. 

This hack won the Jury Prize and Game Prize for Foursquare Hackathon 2013. View the screenshots <a href="https://yangshun.github.io/hipspot/web/" target="_blank">here</a>.
