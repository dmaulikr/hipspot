HipSpot is a location-based game made during Foursquare Hackathon 2013. Players can check-in via Foursquare and check out the available rewards and deals offered by nearby merchants. Playing the mini-games will bring the user various rewards that are redeemable on the spot. This hack won the Jury Prize and Game Prize for Foursquare Hackathon 2013.
